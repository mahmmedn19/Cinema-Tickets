# Movie Ticket Booking Prototype with Jetpack Compose

## Description
This repository contains a design-only prototype of a Movie Ticket Booking application developed using Android Jetpack Compose. The prototype allows users to explore the latest films, browse through different genres, and simulate the process of booking seats at cinemas near them, all from the comfort of their homes.

Please note that this is a design prototype and does not impact real-world data. However, there are plans to potentially develop it into a fully functioning application in the future.

## Features
- Discover and explore the latest films
- Browse movies by different genres
- Simulate the process of booking seats at nearby cinemas
